<h5>The Departure of the Fairies</h5>

<h6>I.</h6>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">I'll tell you a Fairy Tale that's new:</p>
<p>How the merry Elves o'er the ocean flew</p>
<p>From the Emerald isle to this far-off shore,</p>
<p>As they were wont in the days of yore;</p>
<p>And played their pranks one moonlit night,</p>
<p>Where the zephyrs alone could see the sight.</p>
</div></div>
<br>

<h6>II.</h6>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Ere the Old world yet had found the New,</p>
<p>The fairies oft in their frolics flew</p>
<p>To the fragrant isles of the Caribbee&mdash;</p>
<p>Bright bosom-gems of a golden sea.</p>
<p>Too dark was the film of the Indian's eye,</p>
<p>These gossamer sprites to suspect or spy,&mdash;</p>
<p>So they danced 'mid the spicy groves unseen,</p>
<p>And mad were their merry pranks, I ween;</p>
<p>For the fairies, like other discreet little elves,</p>
<p>Are freest and fondest when all by themselves.</p>
<p>No thought had they that in after time,</p>
<p>The Muse would echo their deeds in rhyme;</p>
<p>So gayly doffing light stocking and shoe,</p>
<p>They tripped o'er the meadow all dappled in dew.</p>
</div></div>
<br>

<h6>III.</h6>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">I could tell, if I would, some right merry tales,</p>
<p>Of unslippered fairies that danced in the vales&mdash;</p>
<p>But the lovers of scandal I leave in the lurch&mdash;</p>
<p>And, beside, these elves don't belong to the church.</p>
<p>If they danced&mdash;be it known&mdash;'twas not in the clime</p>
<p>Of your Mathers and Hookers, where laughter was crime;</p>
<p>Where sentinel virtue kept guard o'er the lip,</p>
<p>Though witchcraft stole into the heart by a slip!</p>
<p>Oh no! 'twas the land of the fruit and the flower&mdash;</p>
<p>Where Summer and Spring both dwelt in one bower&mdash;</p>
<p>Where one hung the citron, all ripe from the bough,</p>
<p>And the other with blossoms encircled her brow;</p>
<p>Where the mountains embosomed rich tissues of gold,</p>
<p>And the rivers o'er rubies and emeralds rolled.</p>
<p>It was there, where the seasons came only to bless,</p>
<p>And the fashions of Eden still lingered, in dress,</p>
<p>That these gay little fairies were wont, as I say,</p>
<p>To steal in their merriest gambols away.</p>
<p>But dropping the curtain o'er frolic and fun,</p>
<p>Too good to be told, or too bad to be done,</p>
<p>I give you a legend from Fancy's own sketch,</p>
<p>Though I warn you he's given to fibbing&mdash;the wretch!</p>
<p>Yet I learn by the legends of breezes and brooks,</p>
<p>'Tis as true as the fairy tales told in the books.</p>
</div></div>

<h6>IV.</h6>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">One night, when the moon shone fair on the main,</p>
<p>Choice spirits were gathered from meadow and plain&mdash;</p>
<p>And lightly embarking from Erin's bold cliffs,</p>
<p>They slid o'er the wave in their moonbeam skiffs.</p>
<p>A ray for a rudder&mdash;a thought for a sail&mdash;</p>
<p>Swift, swift was each bark as the wing of the gale.</p>

<p>Yet long were the tale,</p>

<p>What gambol and frolic</p>

<p>How they flirted with bubbles</p>
<p class="i2">That danced on the wave,</p>
<p>Or listened to mermaids</p>
<p class="i2">That sang from the cave;</p>
<p>Or slid with the moonbeams</p>
<p class="i2">Down deep to the grove</p>
<p>Of coral, where mullet</p>
<p class="i2">And goldfish rove:</p>
<p>How there, in long vistas</p>
<p class="i2">Of silence and sleep,</p>
<p>They waltzed, as if mocking</p>
<p class="i2">The death of the deep:</p>
<p>How, oft, where the wreck</p>
<p class="i2">Lay scattered and torn,</p>
<p>They peeped in the skull,</p>
<p class="i2">All ghastly and lorn;</p>
<p>Or deep, 'mid wild rocks,</p>
<p class="i2">Quizzed the goggling shark,</p>
<p>And mouthed at the sea-wolf,</p>
<p class="i2">So solemn and stark;</p>
<p>Each seeming to think</p>
<p class="i2">That the earth and the sea</p>
<p>Were made but for fairies,</p>
<p class="i2">For gambol and glee!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Enough, that at last they came to the Isle,</p>
<p>Where moonlight and fragrance were rivals the while.</p>
<p>Not yet had those vessels from Palos been here,</p>
<p>To turn the bright gem to the blood-mingled tear.</p>
<p>Oh no! still blissful and peaceful the land,</p>
<p>And the merry elves flew from the sea to the strand.</p>
<p>Right happy and joyous seemed now the fond crew,</p>
<p>As they tripped 'mid the orange groves flashing in dew,</p>
<p>For they were to hold a revel that night,</p>
<p>A gay fancy ball, and each to be dight</p>
<p>In the gem or the flower that fancy might choose,</p>
<p>From mountain or vale, for its fragrance or hues.</p>

<h6>VI.</h6>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Away sped the maskers like arrows of light</p>
<p>To gather their gear for the revel bright.</p>
<p>To the dazzling peaks of far-off Peru,</p>
<p>In emulous speed some sportively flew,</p>
<p>And deep in the mine, or 'mid glaciers on high,</p>
<p>For ruby and sapphire searched heedful and sly.</p>
<p>For diamonds rare that gleam in the bed</p>
<p>Of Brazilian streams, some merrily sped,</p>
<p>While others for topaz and emerald stray,</p>
<p>'Mid the cradle cliffs of the Paraguay.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">As these are gathering the rarest of gems,</p>
<p>Others are plucking the rarest of stems.</p>
<p>They range wild dells where the zephyr alone,</p>
<p>To the blushing blossoms before was known;</p>
<p>Through forests they fly, whose branches are hung</p>
<p>By creeping plants, with fair flowerets strung,</p>
<p>Where temples of nature with arches of bloom,</p>
<p>Are lit by the moonlight, and faint with perfume.</p>
<p>They stray where the mangrove and clematis twine,</p>
<p>Where azalia and laurel in rivalry shine;</p>
<p>Where, tall as the oak, the passion-tree glows,</p>
<p>And jasmine is blent with rhodora and rose.</p>
<p>O'er blooming savannas and meadows of light,</p>
<p>'Mid regions of summer they sweep in their flight,</p>
<p>And gathering the fairest, they speed to their bower,</p>
<p>Each one with his favorite brilliant or flower.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Twas a joyous dance, and the dresses were bright,</p>
<p>Such as never were known till that famous night;</p>
<p>For the gems and the flowers that shone in the scene,</p>
<p>O'ermatched the regalia of princess and queen.</p>
<p>No gaudy slave to a fair one's brow</p>
<p>Was the rose, or the ruby, or emerald now,</p>
<p>But lighted with souls by the playful elves,</p>
<p>The brilliants and blossoms seemed dancing themselves.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Of all that did chance, 'twere a long tale to tell,</p>
<p>Of the dresses and waltzes, and who was the belle;</p>
<p>But each was so happy, and all were so fair,</p>
<p>That night stole away and the dawn caught them there!</p>
<p>Such a scampering never before was seen,</p>
<p>As the fairies' flight on that island green.</p>
<p>They rushed to the bay with twinkling feet,</p>
<p>But vain was their haste, for the moonlight fleet</p>
<p>Had passed with the dawn, and never again</p>
<p>Were those fairies permitted to traverse the main.</p>
<p>But 'mid the groves, when the sun was high,</p>
<p>The Indian marked with a worshipping eye,</p>
<p>The HUMMING BIRDS, all unknown before,</p>
<p>Glancing like thoughts from flower to flower,</p>
<p>And seeming as if earth's loveliest things,</p>
<p>The brilliants and blossoms, had taken wings:</p>
<p>And Fancy hath whispered in numbers light,</p>
<p>That these are the fairies who danced that night,</p>
<p>And linger yet in the garb they wore,</p>
<p>Content in our clime and more blest than before!</p>

<p>Mid bursting buds and blushing flowers;</p>
<p>It flourished on the same light stem,</p>
<p>It drank the same clear dews with them.</p>
<p>The crimson tints of summer morn</p>
<p>That gilded one, did each adorn:</p>
<p>The breeze that whispered light and brief</p>
<p>To bud or blossom, kissed the leaf;</p>
<p>When o'er the leaf the tempest flew,</p>
<p>The bud and blossom trembled too.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">But its companions passed away,</p>
<p>And left the leaf to lone decay.</p>
<p>The gentle gales of spring went by:</p>
<p>The fruits and flowers of summer die.</p>
<p>The autumn winds swept o'er the hill,</p>
<p>And winter's breath came cold and chill.</p>
<p>The leaf now yielded to the blast,</p>
<p>And on the rushing stream was cast.</p>
<p>Far, far it glided to the sea,</p>
<p>And whirled and eddied wearily,</p>
<p>Till suddenly it sank to rest,</p>
<p>And slumbered in the ocean's breast.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Thus life begins&mdash;its morning hours,</p>
<p>Bright as the birthday of the flowers&mdash;</p>
<p>Thus passes like the leaves away,</p>
<p>As withered and as lost as they.</p>
<p>Beneath the parent roof we meet</p>
<p>In joyous groups, and gayly greet</p>
<p>The golden beams of love and light,</p>
<p>That dawn upon the youthful sight.</p>
<p>But soon we part, and one by one,</p>
<p>Like leaves and flowers, the group is gone.</p>
<p>One gentle spirit seeks the tomb,</p>
<p>His brow yet fresh with childhood's bloom:</p>
<p>Another treads the paths of fame,</p>
<p>And barters peace to win a name.</p>
<p>Another still, tempts fortune's wave,</p>
<p>And seeking wealth, secures a grave.</p>
<p>The last, grasps yet the brittle thread:</p>
<p>Though friends are gone and joy is dead&mdash;</p>
<p>Still dares the dark and fretful tide,</p>
<p>And clutches at its power and pride&mdash;</p>
<p>Till suddenly the waters sever,</p>
<p>And like the leaf, he sinks for ever!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>Twas morn, and, wending on its way,</p>
<p class="i2">Beside my path a stream was playing;</p>
<p>And down its banks, in humor gay,</p>
<p class="i2">A thoughtless boy was idly straying.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Light as the breeze they onward flew&mdash;</p>

<p class="i2">For long they bounded side by side.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>And now the dimpling water staid,</p>
<p class="i2">And glassed its ripples in a nook;</p>
<p>And on its breast a bubble played,</p>
<p class="i2">Which won the boy's admiring look.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>He bent him o'er the river's brim,</p>
<p class="i2">And on the radiant vision gazed;</p>
<p>For lovelier still it seemed to him,</p>
<p class="i2">That in its breast his imaged blazed.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>With beating heart and trembling finger,</p>
<p class="i2">He stooped the wondrous gem to clasp,</p>
<p>But, spellbound, seemed a while to linger,</p>
<p class="i2">Ere yet he made th' adventurous grasp.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>And still a while the glittering toy,</p>
<p class="i2">Coquettish, seemed to shun the snare,</p>
<p>And then more eager grew the boy,</p>
<p class="i2">And followed with impetuous air.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Round and around, with heedful eyes,</p>
<p class="i2">He chased it o'er the wavy river:</p>
<p>He marked his time and seized his prize,</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Upon the river's marge he sate,</p>
<p class="i2">The tears adown his young cheek gushing;</p>
<p>And long,&mdash;his heart disconsolate&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">He heeded not the river's rushing.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>But tears will cease. And now the boy</p>
<p class="i2">Once more looked forth upon the stream:</p>
<p>'Twas morning still, and lo! a toy,</p>
<p class="i2">Bright as the last one, in the beam!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>He rose&mdash;pursued&mdash;the bubble caught;</p>
<p class="i2">It burst&mdash;he sighed&mdash;then others chased;</p>
<p>And as I parted, still he sought</p>
<p class="i2">New bubbles in their downward haste.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>My onward path I still pursued,</p>
<p class="i2">Till the high noontide sun was o'er me.</p>
<p>And now, though changed in form and mood,</p>
<p class="i2">That Youth and river seemed before me.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>The deepened stream more proudly swept,</p>
<p class="i2">Though chafed by many a vessel's prow;</p>
<p>The Youth in manhood's vigor stept,</p>
<p class="i2">But care was chiselled on his brow.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Still on the stream he kept his eye,</p>
<p class="i2">And wooed the bubbles to the shore,</p>
<p>And snatched them, as they circled by,</p>
<p class="i2">Though bursting as they burst before.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Once more we parted. Yet again</p>
<p class="i2">We met&mdash;though now 'twas evening dim:</p>
<p>Onward the waters rushed amain,</p>
<p class="i2">And vanished o'er a cataract's brim.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Though swift and dark the raging surge,</p>
<p class="i2">The Bubble-Chaser still was there;</p>
<p>And, bending o'er the dizzy verge,</p>
<p class="i2">Clutched at the gaudy things of air.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>With staff in hand and tottering knee,</p>
<p class="i2">Upon the slippery brink he stood,</p>
<p>And watched, with doting ecstasy,</p>
<p class="i2">Each wreath of foam that rode the flood.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>&quot;One bubble more!&quot; I heard him call,</p>
<p class="i2">And saw his trembling fingers play:</p>
<p>He snatched, and down the roaring fall,</p>
<p class="i2">With the lost bubble, passed away!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>In the far off sea there is many a sprite,</p>
<p>Who rests by day, but awakes at night.</p>
<p>In hidden caves where monsters creep,</p>
<p>When the sun is high, these spectres sleep:</p>
<p>From the glance of noon, they shrink with dread,</p>
<p>And hide 'mid the bones of the ghastly dead.</p>
<p>Where the surf is hushed, and the light is dull,</p>
<p>In the hollow tube and the whitened skull,</p>
<p>They crouch in fear or in whispers wail,</p>
<p>For the lingering night, and the coming gale.</p>
<p>But at even-tide, when the shore is dim,</p>
<p>And bubbling wreaths with the billows swim,</p>

<p>I saw a form in the flashing spray,</p>

<p class="i2">As if the deep for their sport was made,</p>

<p>Of the whispering reed by the brook was mute.</p>
<p>The slender rush o'er the glassy rill,</p>
<p>As a marble shaft, was erect and still,</p>
<p>And no airy sylph on the mirror wave,</p>
<p>A dimpling trace of its footstep gave.</p>
<p>The moon shone down, but the shadows deep</p>
<p>Of the pensile flowers, were hushed in sleep.</p>
<p>The pulse was still in that vale of bloom,</p>
<p>And the Spirit rose from its marshy tomb.</p>
<p>It rose o'er the breast of a silver spring,</p>
<p>Where the mist at morn shook its snowy wing,</p>
<p>And robed like the dew, when it woos the flowers.</p>
<p>It stole away to their secret bowers.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>With a lover's sigh, and a zephyr's breath,</p>
<p>It whispered bliss, but its work was death:</p>
<p>It kissed the lip of a rose asleep,</p>
<p>And left it there on its stem to weep:</p>
<p>It froze the drop on a lily's leaf,</p>
<p>And the shivering blossom was bowed in grief.</p>
<p>O'er the gentian it breathed, and the withered flower</p>
<p>Fell blackened and scathed in its lonely bower;</p>
<p>It stooped to the asters all blooming around,</p>
<p>And kissed the buds as they slept on the ground.</p>
<p>They slept, but no morrow could waken their bloom,</p>
<p>And shrouded by moonlight, they lay in their tomb.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>The Frost Spirit went, like the lover light,</p>
<p>In search of fresh beauty and bloom that night</p>
<p>Its wing was plumed by the moon's cold ray,</p>
<p>And noiseless it flew o'er the hills away.</p>
<p>It flew, yet its dallying fingers played,</p>
<p>With a thrilling touch, through the maple's shade;</p>
<p>It toyed with the leaves of the sturdy oak,</p>
<p>It sighed o'er the aspen, and whispering spoke</p>
<p>To the bending sumach, that stooped to throw</p>
<p>Its chequering shade o'er a brook below.</p>
<p>It kissed the leaves of the beech, and breathed</p>
<p>O'er the arching elm, with its ivy wreathed:</p>
<p>It climbed to the ash on the mountain's height&mdash;</p>
<p>It flew to the meadow, and hovering light</p>
<p>O'er leafy forest and fragrant dell,</p>
<p>It bound them all in its silvery spell.</p>
<p>Each spreading bough heard the whispered bliss,</p>
<p>And gave its cheek to the gallant's kiss&mdash;</p>
<p>Though giving, the leaves disdainingly shook,</p>
<p>As if refusing the boon they took.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Who dreamed that the morning's light would speak,</p>
<p>And show that kiss on the blushing cheek?</p>
<p>For in silence the fairy work went through&mdash;</p>
<p>And no croning owl of the scandal knew:</p>
<p>No watch-dog broke from his slumbers light,</p>
<p>To tell the tale to the listening night.</p>
<p>But that which in secret is darkly done,</p>
<p>Is oft displayed by the morrow's sun;</p>
<p>And thus the leaves in the light revealed,</p>
<p>With their glowing hues what the night concealed.</p>
<p>The sweet, frail flowers that once welcomed the morn,</p>
<p>Now drooped in their bowers, all shrivelled and lorn;</p>
<p>While the hardier trees shook their leaves in the blast&mdash;</p>
<p>Though tell-tale colors were over them cast.</p>
<p>The maple blushed deep as a maiden's cheek,</p>
<p>And the oak confessed what it would not speak.</p>
<p>The beech stood mute, but a purple hue</p>
<p>O'er its glossy robe was a witness true.</p>
<p>The elm and the ivy with varying dyes,</p>
<p>Protesting their innocence, looked to the skies:</p>
<p>And the sumach rouged deeper, as stooping to look,</p>
<p>It glanced at the colors that flared in the brook.</p>
<p>The delicate aspen grew nervous and pale,</p>
<p>As the tittering forest seemed full of the tale;</p>
<p>And the lofty ash, though it tossed up its bough,</p>
<p>With a puritan air on the mountain's brow,</p>
<p>Bore a purple tinge o'er its leafy fold,</p>
<p>And the hidden revel was gayly told!</p>

<p>Far, far o'er the deep is my island throne,</p>
<p>Where the sea-gull roams and reigns alone;</p>
<p>Where nought is seen but the beetling rock,</p>
<p>And nought is heard but the ocean-shock,</p>
<p>And the scream of birds when the storm is nigh,</p>
<p>And the crash of the wreck, and the fearful cry</p>
<p>Of drowning men, in their agony.</p>
<p>I love to sit, when the waters sleep,</p>
<p>And ponder the depths of the glassy deep,</p>
<p>Till I dream that I float on a corse at sea,</p>
<p>And sing of the feast that is made for me.</p>
<p>I love on the rush of the storm to sail,</p>
<p>And mingle my scream with the hoarser gale.</p>
<p>When the sky is dark, and the billow high,</p>
<p>When the tempest sweeps in its terror by,</p>
<p>I love to ride on the maddening blast&mdash;</p>
<p>To flap my wing o'er the fated mast,</p>
<p>And sing to the crew a song of fear,</p>
<p>Of the reef and the surge that await them here.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>When the storm is done and the revel is o'er,</p>
<p>I love to sit on the rocky shore,</p>
<p>And tell to the ear of the dying breeze,</p>
<p>The tales that are hushed in the sullen seas;</p>
<p>Of the ship that sank in the reefy surge,</p>
<p>And left her fate to the sea-gull's dirge:</p>
<p>Of the lover that sailed to meet his bride,</p>
<p>And his story gave to the secret tide:</p>
<p>Of the father that went on the trustless main,</p>
<p>And never was met by his child again:</p>
<p>Of the hidden things which the waves conceal,</p>
<p>And the sea-bird's song can alone reveal.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>I tell of the ship that hath found a grave&mdash;</p>
<p>Her spars still float on the restless wave,</p>
<p>But down in the halls of the voiceless deep,</p>
<p>The forms of the brave and the beautiful sleep.</p>
<p>I saw the storm as it gathered fast,</p>
<p>I heard the roar of the coming blast,</p>
<p>I marked the ship in her fearful strife,</p>
<p>As she flew on the tide, like a thing of life.</p>
<p>But the whirlwind came, and her masts were wrung,</p>
<p>Away, and away on the waters flung.</p>
<p>I sat on the gale o'er the sea-swept deck,</p>
<p>And screamed in delight o'er the coming wreck:</p>
<p>I flew to the reef with a heart of glee,</p>
<p>And wiled the ship to her destiny.</p>
<p>On the hidden rocks like a hawk she rushed,</p>
<p>And the sea through her riven timbers gushed:</p>
<p>O'er the whirling surge the wreck was flung,</p>
<p>And loud on the gale wild voices rung.</p>
<p>I gazed on the scene&mdash;I saw despair</p>
<p>On the pallid brows of a youthful pair.</p>
<p>The maiden drooped like a gentle flower,</p>
<p>When lashed by the gale in its quivering bower:</p>
<p>Her arms round her lover she wildly twined,</p>
<p>And gazed on the sea with a wildered mind.</p>
<p>He bent o'er the trembler, and sheltered her form,</p>
<p>From the plash of the sea, and the sweep of the storm;</p>
<p>But woe to the lover, and woe to the maid,</p>
<p>Whose hopes on the treacherous deep are laid!</p>
<p>For the Sea hath a King whose palaces shine,</p>
<p>In lustre and light down the pearly brine,</p>
<p>And he loves to gather in glory there,</p>
<p>The choicest things of the earth and air.</p>
<p>In his deep saloons with coral crowned,</p>
<p>Where gems are sparkling above and around,</p>
<p>He gathers his harem of love and grace,</p>
<p>And beauty he takes to his cold embrace.</p>
<p>The winds and the waves are his messengers true.</p>
<p>And lost is the wanderer whom they pursue.</p>
<p>They sweep the shore, they plunder the wreck,</p>
<p>His stores to heap, and his halls to deck.</p>
<p>Oh! lady and lover, ye are doomed their prey&mdash;</p>
<p>They come! they come! ye are swept away!</p>
<p>Ye sink in the tide,&mdash;but it cannot sever</p>
<p>The fond ones who sleep in its depths for ever!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Wild! wild was the storm, and loud was its roar,</p>
<p>And strange were the sights that I hovered o'er:</p>
<p>I saw the babe with its mother die;</p>
<p>I listened to catch its parting sigh;</p>
<p>And I laughed to see the black billows play</p>
<p>With the sleeping child in their gambols gay.</p>
<p>I saw a girl whose arms were white,</p>
<p>As the foam that flashed on the billows' height;</p>
<p>And the ripples played with her glossy curls,</p>
<p>And her cheek was kissed by the dancing whirls;</p>
<p>But her bosom was dead to hope and fear,</p>
<p>For she shuddered not as the shark came near.</p>
<p>I poised my foot on the forehead fair</p>
<p>Of a lovely boy that floated there;</p>
<p>I looked in the eyes of the drowning brave,</p>
<p>As they upward gazed through the glassy wave;</p>
<p>I screamed o'er the bubbles that told of death,</p>
<p>And stooped as the last gave up his breath.</p>
<p>I flapped my wing, for the work was done&mdash;</p>
<p>The storm was hushed, and the laughing sun</p>
<p>Sent his gushing light o'er the sullen seas&mdash;</p>
<p>And I tell my tale to the fainting breeze,</p>
<p>Of the hidden things which the waves conceal,</p>
<p>And the sea-bird's song can alone reveal!</p>

<p>The forest like a flight of spears, aloft:</p>
<p>In wooded vales that spread beyond the view;</p>
<p>In boundless prairies, blooming fair and soft;</p>
<p>In mantling vines that teem with clusters blue;</p>
<p>And as the sunny south upon us breathes&mdash;</p>

<p>Two neighbors, living on a hill,</p>

<p>The one was Jones,&mdash;a thrifty wight&mdash;</p>
<p>Whose mill in every wind went right.</p>
<p>The storm and tempest vainly spent</p>
<p>Their rage upon it&mdash;round it went!</p>
<p>E'en when the summer breeze was light,</p>
<p>The whirling wings performed their flight;</p>
<p>And hence a village saying rose&mdash;</p>
<p>&quot;As sure as Jones's mill, it goes.&quot;</p>

<p>Not so with neighbor Smith's&mdash;close by;</p>
<p>Full half the time it would not ply:</p>
<p>Save only when the wind was west,</p>
<p>Still as a post it stood at rest.</p>
<p>By every tempest it was battered,</p>
<p>By every thundergust 'twas shattered;</p>
<p>Through many a rent the rain did filter;</p>
<p>And, fair or foul, 'twas out of kilter;</p>
<p>And thus the saying came at last&mdash;</p>
<p>&quot;Smith's mill is made for folks that fast.&quot;</p>

<p>Smith held to faith, but not to works;</p>
<p>While Jones believed in both, and so,</p>
<p>By faith and practice, made it go!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Smith prayed, and straight sent in his bill,</p>
<p>Expecting Heaven to tend his mill;</p>
<p>And grumbled sore, whene'er he found</p>
<p>That wheels ungreased would not go round.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Not so with Jones&mdash;for, though as prayerful,</p>
<p>To grease his wheels he e'er was careful,</p>

<p>That ruthless time or tempest sent;</p>
<p>And thus, by works, his faith expressed,</p>
<p>Good neighbor Jones by Heaven was blessed.</p>

<h5>The Dream of Youth</h5>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>In days of yore, while yet the world was new,</p>
<p>And all around was beautiful to view&mdash;</p>
<p>When spring or summer ruled the happy hours,</p>
<p>And golden fruit hung down mid opening flowers;</p>
<p>When, if you chanced among the woods to stray,</p>
<p>The rosy-footed dryad led the way,&mdash;</p>
<p>Or if, beside a mountain brook, your path,</p>
<p>You ever caught some na&iuml;ad at her bath:</p>
<p>'Twas in that golden day, that Damon strayed.</p>
<p>Musing, alone, along a Grecian glade.</p>
<p>Retired the scene, yet in the morning light,</p>
<p>Athens in view, shone glimmering to the sight.</p>
<p>'Twas far away, yet painted on the skies,</p>
<p>It seemed a marble cloud of glorious dyes,</p>
<p>Where yet the rosy morn, with lingering ray,</p>
<p>Loved on the sapphire pediments to play.</p>
<p>But why did Damon heed the <i>distant</i> scene?</p>
<p>For he was young, and all around was green:</p>
<p>A noisy brook was romping through the dell,</p>
<p>And on his ear the laughing echoes fell:</p>
<p>Along his path the stooping wild flowers grew,</p>
<p>And woo'd the very zephyrs as they flew.</p>
<p>Then why young Damon, heeding nought around,</p>
<p>Seemed in some thrall of distant vision bound,</p>
<p>I cannot tell&mdash;but dreamy grew his gaze,</p>
<p>And all his thought was in a misty maze.</p>
<p>Awhile he sauntered&mdash;then beneath a tree,</p>
<p>He sat him down, and there a reverie</p>
<p>Came o'er his spirit like a spell,&mdash;and bright,</p>
<p>A truth-like vision, shone upon his sight.</p>
<p>Around on every side, with glowing pinions,</p>
<p>A circling band, as if from Jove's dominions,</p>
<p>All wooing came, and sought with wily art,</p>
<p>To steal away the youthful dreamer's heart.</p>
<p>One offered wealth&mdash;another spoke of fame,</p>
<p>And held a wreath to twine around his name.</p>
<p>One brought the pallet, and the magic brush,</p>
<p>By which creative art bids nature blush,</p>
<p>To see her rival&mdash;and the artful boy,</p>
<p>His story told&mdash;the all-entrancing joy</p>
<p>His skill could give,&mdash;but well the rogue concealed</p>
<p>The piercing thorns that flourish, unrevealed,</p>
<p>Along the artist's path&mdash;the poverty, the strife</p>
<p>Of study, and the weary waste of life&mdash;</p>
<p>All these, the drawback of his wily tale,</p>
<p>The little artist covered with a veil.</p>
<p class="i2">Young Damon listened, and his heart beat high&mdash;</p>
<p>But now a cunning archer gained his eye&mdash;</p>
<p>And stealing close, he whispered in his ear,</p>
<p>A glowing tale, so musical and dear,</p>
<p>That Damon vowed, like many a panting youth,</p>
<p>To Love, eternal constancy and truth!</p>
<p>But while the whisper from his bosom broke,</p>
<p>A fearful Image to his spirit spoke:</p>
<p>With frowning brow, and giant arm he stood,</p>
<p>Holding a glass, as if in threatening mood,</p>
<p>He waited but a moment for the sand,</p>
<p>To sweep the idle Dreamer from the land!</p>
<p class="i2">Young Damon started, and his dream was o'er,</p>
<p>But to his soul, the seeming vision bore</p>
<p>A solemn meaning, which he could not spurn&mdash;</p>
<p>And Youth, perchance, may from our fable learn,</p>
<p>That while the beckoning passions woo and sigh,</p>
<p>TIME, with his ready scythe, stands listening by.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>Friend of my early days, we meet once more!</p>
<p class="i2">Once more I stand thine aged boughs beneath,</p>
<p>And hear again the rustling music pour,</p>
<p class="i2">Along thy leaves, as whispering spirits breathe.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Full many a day of sunshine and of storm,</p>
<p class="i2">Since last we parted, both have surely known;</p>
<p>Thy leaves are thinned, decrepit is thy form,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">And all my cherished visions, they are flown!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>How beautiful, how brief, those sunny hours</p>
<p class="i2">Departed now, when life was in its spring&mdash;</p>
<p>When Fancy knew no scene undecked with flowers,</p>
<p class="i2">And Expectation flew on Fancy's wing!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Here, on the bank, beside this whispering stream,</p>
<p class="i2">Which still runs by as gayly as of yore,</p>
<p>Marking its eddies, I was wont to dream</p>
<p class="i2">Of things away, on some far fairy shore.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Then every whirling leaf and bubbling ball,</p>
<p class="i2">That floated by, was full of radiant thought;</p>
<p>Each linked with love, had music at its call,</p>
<p class="i2">And thrilling echoes o'er my bosom brought.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>The bird that sang within this gnarled oak,</p>
<p class="i2">The waves that dallied with its leafy shade,</p>
<p>The mellow murmurs from its boughs that broke,</p>
<p class="i2">Their joyous tribute to my spirit paid.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>No phantom rose to tell of future ill,</p>
<p class="i2">No grisly warning marr'd my prophet dreams&mdash;</p>
<p>My heart translucent as the leaping rill,</p>
<p class="i2">My thoughts all free and flashing at its beams.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Here is the grassy knoll I used to seek</p>
<p class="i2">At summer noon, beneath the spreading shade,</p>
<p>And watch the flowers that stooped with glowing cheek,</p>
<p class="i2">To meet the romping ripples as they played.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Here is the spot which memory's magic glass</p>
<p class="i2">Hath often brought, arrayed in fadeless green,</p>
<p>Making this oak, this brook, this waving grass&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">A simple group&mdash;fond Nature's fairest scene.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>And as I roamed beside the Rhone or Rhine,</p>
<p class="i2">Or other favored stream, in after days,</p>
<p>With jealous love, this rivulet would shine,</p>
<p class="i2">Full on my heart, and claim accustomed praise.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>And oh! how oft by sorrow overborne,</p>
<p class="i2">By care oppressed, or bitter malice wrung,</p>
<p>By friends betrayed, or disappointment torn,</p>
<p class="i2">My weary heart, all sickened and unstrung&mdash;</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Hath yearned to leave the bootless strife afar,</p>
<p class="i2">And find beneath this oak a quiet grave,</p>
<p>Where the rough echo of the world's loud jar,</p>
<p class="i2">Yields to the music of the mellow wave!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>And now again I stand this stream beside;</p>
<p class="i2">Again I hear the silver ripples flow&mdash;</p>
<p>I mark the whispers murmuring o'er the tide,</p>
<p class="i2">And the light bubbles trembling as they go.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>But oh! the magic-spell that lingered here,</p>
<p class="i2">In boyhood's golden age, my heart to bless,</p>
<p>With the bright waves that rippled then so clear,</p>
<p class="i2">Is lost in ocean's dull forgetfulness.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Gone are the visions of that glorious time&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Gone are the glancing birds I loved so well,</p>
<p>Nor will they wake again their silver chime,</p>
<p class="i2">From the deep tomb of night in which they dwell!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>And if perchance some fleeting memories steal,</p>
<p class="i2">Like far-off echoes to my dreaming ear,</p>
<p>Away, ungrasped, the cheating visions wheel,</p>
<p class="i2">As spectres start upon the wing of fear.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Alas! the glorious sun, which then was high,</p>
<p class="i2">Touching each common thing with rosy light,</p>
<p>Is darkly banished from the lowering sky&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">And life's dull onward pathway lies, in night.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Yes&mdash;I am changed&mdash;and this gray gnarled form,</p>
<p class="i2">Its leaves all scattered by the rending blast,</p>
<p>Is but an image of my heart;&mdash;the storm&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">The storm of life, doth make us such at last!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Farewell, old oak! I leave thee to the wind,</p>
<p class="i2">And go to struggle with the chafing tide&mdash;</p>
<p>Soon to the dust thy form shall be resigned,</p>
<p class="i2">And I would sleep thy crumbling limbs beside.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Thy memory will pass; thy sheltering shade,</p>
<p class="i2">Will weave no more its tissue o'er the sod;</p>
<p>And all thy leaves, ungathered in the glade,</p>
<p class="i2">Shall, by the reckless hoof of time, be trod.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>My cherished hopes, like shadows and like leaves,</p>
<p class="i2">Name, fame, and fortune&mdash;each shall pass away;</p>
<p>And all that castle-building fancy weaves,</p>
<p class="i2">Shall sleep, unthinking, as the drowsy clay.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>But from thy root another tree shall bloom&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">With living leaves its tossing boughs shall rise;</p>
<p>And the winged spirit&mdash;bursting from the tomb,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Oh, shall it spring to light beyond these skies?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">On a tall cliff that overhung the deep,</p>
<p>A maniac stood. He heeded not the sweep</p>
<p>Of the swift gale that lashed the troubled main,</p>
<p>And spread with showery foam the watery plain.</p>
<p>His reckless foot was on the dizzy line</p>
<p>That edged the rock, impending o'er the brine;</p>
<p>His form was bent, and leaning from the height,</p>
<p>Like the light gull whose wing is stretched for flight.</p>
<p>Far down beneath his feet, the surges broke;</p>
<p>Above his head the pealing thunders spoke;</p>
<p>Around him flashed the lightning's ruddy glare,</p>
<p>And rushing torrents swept along the air.</p>
<p>But nought he heeded, save a gallant sail</p>
<p>That on the sea was wrestling with the gale.</p>
<p>Far on the ocean's billowy verge she hung,</p>
<p>And strove to shun the storm that landward swung.</p>
<p>With many a tack she turned her bending side</p>
<p>To the rude blast, and bravely stemmed the tide.</p>
<p>In vain! the bootless strife with fate is o'er&mdash;</p>
<p>And the doomed vessel nears the iron shore.</p>
<p>A mighty bird, she seems, whose wing is rent</p>
<p>By the red shaft from heaven's fierce quiver sent.</p>
<p>Her mast is shivered and her helm is lashed,</p>
<p>Around her prow the kindled waves are dashed&mdash;</p>
<p>And as an eagle swooping in its might,</p>
<p>Toward the dark cliff she speeds her headlong flight.</p>
<p>She comes, she strikes! the trembling wave withdraws,</p>
<p>And the hushed elements a moment pause;</p>
<p>Then swelling high above their helpless prey,</p>
<p>The billows burst, and bear the wreck away!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">One look to heaven the raptured Maniac cast,</p>
<p>One low breathed murmur from his bosom passed:</p>
<p>'God of the soul and sea! I read thy choice&mdash;</p>
<p>Told by the shipwreck and the whirlwind's voice.</p>
<p>In this dread omen I can trace my doom,</p>
<p>And hear thee bid me seek an ocean-tomb.</p>
<p>Like the lost ship my weary mind hath striven</p>
<p>With the wild tempest o'er my spirit driven;</p>
<p>That strife is done&mdash;and the dim caverned sea</p>
<p>Of this wrecked bosom must the mansion be.</p>
<p>Thou who canst bid the billows cease to roll,</p>
<p>Oh! smooth a pillow for my weary soul&mdash;</p>
<p>Watch o'er the pilgrim in his shadowy sleep,</p>
<p>And send sweet dreams to light the sullen deep!'</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Thus spoke the maniac, while above he gazed,</p>
<p>And his pale hands beseechingly upraised;</p>
<p>Then on the viewless wind he swiftly sprung,</p>
<p>And far below his senseless form was flung;</p>
<p>A thin white spray told where he met the wave,</p>
<p>And battling surges thunder o'er his grave!</p>

<p class="i2">A ray of light&mdash;a golden dream&mdash;</p>
<p>A morning fair&mdash;a path of flowers!</p>
<p class="i2">But now another charm came o'er me:</p>
<p>The ocean I had never seen;</p>

<p class="i2">I bade my home adieu, and bent</p>
<p>My eager footsteps toward the shore,</p>
<p class="i2">And soon my native hills were blent,</p>
<p>With the pale sky that arched them o'er.</p>
<p class="i2">Four days were passed, and now I stood</p>

<p class="i2">Before me rolled the boundless flood,</p>
<p>A glorious dreamer in its sleep.</p>
<p class="i2">'Twas summer morn, and bright as heaven;</p>
<p>And though I wept, I was not sad,</p>
<p class="i2">For tears, thou knowest, are often given</p>
<p>When the overflowing heart is glad.</p>
<p>Long, long I watched the waves, whose whirls</p>
<p class="i2">Leaped up the rocks, their brows to kiss,</p>
<p>And dallied with the sea-weed curls,</p>
<p class="i2">That stooped and met, as if in bliss.</p>
<p>Long, long I listened to the peal,</p>
<p class="i2">That whispered from the pebbly shore,</p>
<p>And like a spirit seemed to steal</p>
<p class="i2">In music to my bosom's core.</p>
<p>And now I looked afar, and thought</p>
<p class="i2">The sea a glad and glorious thing;</p>
<p>And fancy to my bosom brought</p>
<p class="i2">Wild dreams upon her wizard wing&mdash;</p>
<p>Her wing that stretched o'er spreading waves,</p>
<p class="i2">And chased the far-off flashing ray,</p>
<p>Or hovering deep in twilight caves,</p>
<p class="i2">Caught the lone mermaid at her play.</p>

<p class="i2">I heard the battle-cry that flew</p>
<p>Along the cliff, as though t'were given</p>
<p class="i2">To cheer the elemental war;</p>

<p class="i2">No father's hand my pride to yoke,</p>

<p>The desolation of the soul,</p>
<p class="i2">When the rough, gale hath ceased to blow,</p>
<p>Yet o'er it bids the billow roll.</p>
<p class="i2">A helmless wreck upon the tide&mdash;</p>
<p>An earthquake's ruin wrapped in gloom&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">A gnarled oak blasted in its pride&mdash;</p>
<p>Are feeble emblems of my doom.</p>
<p class="i2">There is a tongue in every leaf,</p>
<p>A sigh in every tossing tree&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">A murmur in each wave; of grief</p>

<p class="i2">Nature hath many voices&mdash;strings</p>

<p class="i2">At night, when the pale moonlight falls</p>

<p class="i2">And glorious through these mountain halls,</p>
<p>Pours in a flood its silvery wave&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">I climb the cliff, and hear the song,</p>

<p class="i2">I hear the cataract thundering strong</p>
<p>From far; I hear the wave that peals</p>
<p class="i2">Along the lone lake's pebbly shore;</p>
<p>I hear the sweeping gust that weaves</p>
<p class="i2">The tree tops, and the winds that pour</p>
<p>In rippling lapses through the leaves.</p>
<p class="i2">And as the diapason sweeps</p>
<p>Across the breast of night, the moan</p>
<p class="i2">Of wolves upon the spirit creeps,</p>
<p>Lending the hymn a wilder tone.</p>
<p class="i2">The panther's wail, the owlet's scream,</p>
<p>The whippoorwill's complaining song,</p>
<p class="i2">Blend with the cataract's solemn theme,</p>
<p>And the wild cadences prolong.</p>
<p class="i2">And often when the heart is chilled</p>
<p>By the deep harmony, the note</p>
<p class="i2">Of some light-hearted bird is trilled</p>
<p>Upon the breeze. How sweet its throat!</p>
<p class="i2">Yet, as a gem upon the finger</p>
<p>Of a pale corse, deepens the gloom,</p>
<p class="i2">By its bright rays that laugh and linger</p>
<p>In the dread bosom of the tomb;</p>
<p class="i2">So doth the note of that wild bird,</p>

<p>And made these mountains echo with their cry&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">And they have mouldered&mdash;and their mighty hand</p>
<p>Hath writ no record on the earth or sky!</p>
<p class="i2">And 'mid the awful stillness of their grave,</p>
<p>The forest oaks have flourished; and the breath</p>
<p class="i2">Of years hath swept their races, wave on wave,</p>
<p>As ages fainted on the shores of death.</p>
<p class="i2">The tumbling cliff perchance hath thundered deep,</p>
<p>Like a rough note of music in the song</p>
<p class="i2">Of centuries, and the whirlwind's crushing sweep,</p>
<p>Hath ploughed the forest with its furrows strong.</p>
<p class="i2">And though these legends, like the eddying leaves</p>
<p>Of autumn, scattered by the whirlwind's breath,</p>
<p class="i2">Are borne away where dim Oblivion weaves</p>
<p>Her shroud, within the rayless halls of death;</p>
<p class="i2">Still with a prophet gaze I'll thread my way,</p>
<p>And wake the giant spectres of the tomb;</p>
<p class="i2">With fancy's wand I'll chase the phantoms gray,</p>
<p>And burst the shadowy seal that shrouds their doom.</p>
<p class="i2">Thus shall the past its misty lore unfold,</p>
<p>And bid my soul on nature's ladder rise,</p>
<p class="i2">Till I shall meet some clasping hand, whose hold</p>
<p>Shall draw my homesick spirit to the skies.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>When man from Paradise was driven,</p>
<p>And thorns around his pathway sprung,</p>
<p>Sweet Mercy wandering there from heaven</p>
<p>Upon those thorns bright roses flung.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Aye, and as Justice cursed the ground,</p>
<p>She stole behind, unheard, unseen&mdash;</p>
<p>And while the curses fell around,</p>
<p>She scattered seeds of joy between.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>And thus, as evils sprung to light,</p>
<p>And spread, like weeds, their poisons wide,</p>
<p>Fresh healing plants came blooming bright,</p>
<p>And stood, to check them, side by side.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>And now, though Eden blooms afar,</p>
<p>And man is exiled from its bowers,</p>
<p>Still mercy steals through bolt and bar,</p>
<p>And brings away its choicest flowers.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>The very toil, the thorns of care,</p>
<p>That Heaven in wrath for sin imposes,</p>
<p>By mercy changed, no curses are&mdash;</p>
<p>One brings us rest, the other roses.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Thus joy is linked with every woe&mdash;</p>
<p>Each cup of ill its pleasure brings;</p>
<p>The rose is crushed, but then, you know,</p>
<p>The sweeter fragrance from it springs.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>If justice throw athwart our way,</p>
<p>A deepening eve of fear and sorrow,</p>
<p>Hope, like the moon, reflects the ray</p>
<p>Of the bright sun that shines to-morrow.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>And mercy gilds with stars the night;</p>
<p>Sweet music plays through weeping willows;</p>
<p>The blackest cave with gems is bright,</p>
<p>And pearls illume the ocean billows.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>The very grave, though clouds may rise,</p>
<p>And shroud it o'er with midnight gloom,</p>
<p>Unfolds to faith the deep blue skies,</p>
<p>That glorious shine beyond the tomb.</p>

<a name="The_Mountain_Stream"></a><h2>The Mountain Stream</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>One summer morn, while yet the thrilling lay,</p>
<p>Of the dew-loving lark was full and strong,</p>
<p>Trampling the wild flowers in my careless way,</p>
<p>Up the steep mountain-side I strode along&mdash;</p>
<p>My only guide, a brook whose joyous song,</p>
<p>Seemed like a boy's light-hearted roundelay,</p>
<p>As down it rushed, the leafy bowers among,</p>
<p>Scattering o'er bud and bloom its pearly spray&mdash;</p>
<p>A beauteous semblance of life's opening day.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>And looking back to that all-gladdening morn,</p>
<p>When I was free and sportive as the stream&mdash;</p>
<p>When roses blushed with no suspected thorn,</p>
<p>And fancy's sunlight gilded every dream&mdash;</p>
<p>While hope yet shed its sweet delusive beam,</p>
<p>And disappointment still delayed to warn&mdash;</p>
<p>With fond regret, I still pursued the theme&mdash;</p>
<p>With clambering step still up the steep was borne,</p>
<p>Too sad to smile, too pleased perchance to mourn.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>And now I stood beside that rivulet's spring,</p>
<p>That came unbidden with a bubbling bound&mdash;</p>
<p>And stealing forth, a gentle trembling thing,</p>
<p>It seemed an infant fearing all around&mdash;</p>
<p>Yet clinging to its mother's breast&mdash;the ground.</p>
<p>But soon it bolder grew, and with a wing</p>
<p>It went: its carol was a joyous sound,</p>
<p>Making the silent woods responsive ring,</p>
<p>And the far forest-echoes, sighing, sing.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>And now I stood upon the mountain's height&mdash;</p>
<p>Like a wide map, the landscape lay unrolled&mdash;</p>
<p>There could I trace that rivulet's path of light,</p>
<p>From the steep mountain to the sea of gold;</p>
<p>Now leaping o'er the rocks like chamois bold,&mdash;</p>
<p>Now like a crouching hare concealed from sight,&mdash;</p>
<p>Now hid beneath the willow's bowering fold,</p>
<p>As if they sought to stay its arrowy flight,</p>
<p>Then give it forth again more swift and bright.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>'Twas changeful&mdash;beautiful; now dark, now fair&mdash;</p>
<p>A tale of life, from childhood to the tomb&mdash;</p>
<p>Its birth-place near the skies, in mountain air,</p>
<p>Where wild flowers throw around their sweet perfume,</p>
<p>Like the blest thoughts that often brightly bloom,</p>
<p>At home, beneath a mother's culturing care&mdash;</p>
<p>Its form now hid in shadows, such as gloom</p>
<p>Our downward way&mdash;its grave in ocean, where</p>
<p>It mingles with the wave&mdash;a dweller there!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>And though that stream be hidden from the view,</p>
<p>'Tis yet preserved 'neath ocean's briny crest:</p>
<p>That wide eternity of waves is true&mdash;</p>
<p>And as the planets anchored in their rest,</p>
<p>The sparkling streamlet lives; and while unblest,</p>
<p>The land-wave stagnant lingers&mdash;there the blue</p>
<p>Tide holds the river stainless in its breast&mdash;</p>
<p>An image still of life, that sparkles through</p>
<p>The starry deep of heaven, for ever new.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

opportunities to fix the problem.

provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
